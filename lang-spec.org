#+title: Fn Language Specification
#+author: Jack Pugmire

* About this Document

This document fully specifies the syntax and semantics of the Fn programming
language. Any part of it may be changed at any time. Since the interpreter is
still unfinished, its actual behavior may differ from what's described here.

Section [[Language Description]] contains a description of the semantics of Fn. It's
meant to read like a user's manual, and should cover everything about the core
language when it's done. I'm trying to make this readable.

After this comes the technical part of the document. It's a big old list of all
the types of expressions in Fn with precise descriptions of their behaviors.

Following this is the lexical analysis section. This rounds out the
specification by giving a character-by-character description of Fn syntax. I'm
planning to rewrite this at some point. It's in rough shape after repeated
cut-and-pastes from different documents.

At the end is some other miscellaneous stuff I copied from old design documents
because I didn't want to delete it from the main repository yet.

There will be more sections (and subsections!) in the future.


* Language Description

** Overview

Fn is a dynamically typed, garbage-collected, general-purpose programming
language with Lisp-like syntax. A couple of its defining characteristics are:
- The core language has relatively few operators, with special care taken to
  ensure they have consistent and concise syntax.
- Fn is designed for a "mostly functional" programming style, where immutability
  and referential transparency are favored, but not required.
- The native macro system allows definition of new syntax (and even entire
  domain-specific languages) using regular Fn code and data structures.

The syntax looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC fn
(def sqrt-precision 0.001)
(def approx-sqrt (x)
  (letfn iterate (guess)
    (if (< (abs (- x (* guess guess)) sqrt-precision))
        guess
        (iterate (/ (+ guess (/ x guess) 2)))))
  (if (>= x 0)
      (iterate (/ x 2))
      (error "Cannot approximate square root of a negative number.")))
#+END_SRC


** Variables and Mutation

*** Local Variables

Local variables can be created using one of the special operators ~let~, ~letfn~, or
~with~.[fn:let-other-lisp] They all bind variables in the same way, but with
different syntax for programmer convenience. Function parameters are also
treated as local variables within the function body.

Before proceeding, we note that the full story about local variables involves
variable capture semantics, which are covered in a later section. Variable
capture doesn't affect any of the concepts discussed in the rest of this section.

~let~ is the most elementary way to create a local variable. It defines one or
more new variables in the current lexical environment.

#+BEGIN_SRC fn  ;; let binds one or more variables to the given values
;; let binds variables to the given values
(let x 'symbol)
;; multiple definitions can be made in a single let
(let a 16
     b (reverse "string")
     ;; value expressions can refer to variables from earlier in the same let
     c (+ a (length b))
#+END_SRC

~with~ is similar to ~let~, but rather than creating definitions in the containing
environment, it creates a new lexical environment.

#+BEGIN_SRC fn
;; this creates two variables
(with (a 3
       b 4)
  ;; the body can contain multiple expressions
  (println "hello")
  (+ a b))
;; returns 7
;; the variables a, b do not exist outside of the with body
#+END_SRC

~letfn~ has a streamlined syntax for creating functions, but otherwise behaves
like ~let~. See the documentation below for details.

All local variables can have their value changed with ~set!~. The exclamation
point is because mutation is not to be taken lightly. The syntax for ~set!~ is
like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC fn
(set! var-name new-value)
;; for example
(let var 'hi)
(println var) ;; prints 'hi
(set! var 'lo)
(println var) ;; prints 'lo
#+END_SRC

Note that attempting to ~set!~ a global variable will result in an error.

[fn:let-other-lisp] In Fn, the ~with~ operator provides the functionality of what
most Lisp-like languages call ~let~, while Fn's ~let~ is quite different, as it acts
on the surrounding environment.


*** Global Variables

Global variables in Fn are created using ~def~ or ~defn~. E.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC fn
(def my-global 'special-constant)
(def my-other-global (+ 21 69))
#+END_SRC

~defn~ behaves exactly like ~def~, but has special syntax streamlined for defining
functions.

Global variables are immutable, i.e. they cannot be changed by using ~set!~.
However, by assigning global variables to mutable datatypes or by exploiting
variable capture (discussed in a later section), mutable state can still be
associated to a global variable. This is intended behavior, however, it is not
recommended that you abuse it.


** Data Types

Fn provides the following builtin data types (type names in Fn are
~Capitalized-Like-This~):

- ~Nil~ :: The special constant ~nil~, used to indicate no value.
- ~Bool~ :: The special boolean constants ~true~ and ~false~.
- ~Num~ :: Floating-point numbers. (These are almost IEEE 64-bit floats, but we
  truncate the significand by three bits to fit type information).
- ~Symbol~ :: Internalized strings. These are essentially strings with a faster
  equality test, at the expensive of slower access to the characters of the
  string. They are used extensively by the macro system.
- ~String~ :: (Immutable) sequences of bytes. Usually these are UTF-8 encoded
  character streams.
- ~List~ :: (Immutable) singley-linked lists.
- ~Table~ :: Mutable key-value stores.

Of these, only lists and tables logically contain other values. (Substrings can
be extracted from strings, but this actually creates a new string object and
just copies in data from the other string). So, we call ~List~ and ~Table~ the two
*compound data types*, and call the rest of them *simple data types*.

*** Simple Data Types
Here is what the syntax looks like for the simple data types:

#+BEGIN_SRC fn
;; numbers are pretty much what you'd expect
2
-6
3.14159
2.0e-6 ;; we have scientific notation
0xFf ;; hexadecimal, even!

;; strings are enclosed within matched double quotes
"string"
"Fn uses escape codes from C, e.g. \\ \"\n"
""

;; symbols are prefixed by a single quote.
'sym1
'sym2
;; symbols can contain whitespace and syntax characters, provided they are 
;; escaped with a backslash
'sym\ with\ \"escapes\"
;; be careful about the quote operator. If the quoted expression is a number,
;; it will result in a number instead of a symbol. You can get around this 
;; with escapes:
'0xb8  ;; this is a number
'\0xb8 ;; this is a symbol

;; booleans and nil are called by name
true
false
nil
#+END_SRC

See also subsection [[Quoting]] for more on symbols and the quote operator.


*** Lists

Lists in Fn are what you'd expect for a functional programming language. They're
created using square brackets or by using the ~List~ function.

#+BEGIN_SRC fn
[] ; empty list
['a 'b] ; list of two symbols
[1 'a "str"] ; lists may contain objects of arbitrary type

;; List is identical to square bracket syntax
[1 2 3]
(List 1 2 3)
#+END_SRC

Lists can be manipulated with builtin functions:

#+BEGIN_SRC fn
(def list1 [["str" 2] 'a 'b])
(def list2 [0 2 4 6 8 10])

;; head and tail access the head and tail of the list
(head list1) ;=> ["str" 2]
(head list2) ;=> 0
(tail list1) ;=> ['a 'b]

(tail [])    ;=> []
(head [])    ;=> error (empty list has no head)

;; nth allows random access:
(nth list1 2) ;=> 'b
(nth list2 1) ;=> 2

;; length gives the length of a list
(length []) ;=> 0
(length list1) ;=> 3
(length list2) ;=> 6

;; cons prepends elements
(cons 2 []) ;=> [2]
(cons nil list1) ;=> [nil ["str" 2] 'a 'b]

;; concat concatenates two or more lists
(concat [1 2 3] [4 5 6]) ;=> [1 2 3 4 5 6]
(concat [37] ['foo] ["bar"]) ;=> [37 'foo "bar"]
(concat list2 list1) ;=> [0 2 4 6 8 10 ["str" 2] 'a 'b]

;; reverse reverse the direction of a list
(reverse list2) => [10 8 6 4 2 0]
#+END_SRC


*** TODO Tables

Tables are key-value stores. Any type of object may be used as a key or a value,
(note, however, that it takes longer to hash more complicated data structures
since we have to descend on their fields)[fn:key-equality].

Tables are built using braces ~{}~ or the equivalent ~Table~ function. This must be
passed an even number of arguments.

#+BEGIN_SRC fn
{} ;=> empty table
{'key1 4 'key 6} ;=> table with two kv-pairs
(Table 'key1 4 'key 6) ;=> table with two kv-pairs
#+END_SRC

Table elements may be accessed using the builtin function ~get~. When the key is a
constant symbol, dot syntax (or the equivalent ~dot~ special operator) can be
used instead. This is how this looks:

#+BEGIN_SRC fn
(def tab1 {'name "Mr. Table"
          'occupation "Holds data"
          'child {'name "Table Jr." 
                  'occupation "Holds less data"}})
(def tab2 {0 'zero 1 'one 2 'two 3 'three 4 'four})

;; these all return "Mr. Table"
(get tab1 'name)
tab1.name
(dot tab1 name) ; equivalent syntax to the dot expression
;; Note that the symbols in the dot expressions are unquoted. Arguments to dot 
;; must be unquoted symbols or a compilation error occurs.

;; get is more flexible than dot and allows arbitrary key and value expressions
(get tab2 (+ 1 2)) ;=> 'three
(get {'k 'v} 'k) ;=> 'v

;; dot makes it convenient to descend on tables with symbolic key names
tab1.child.name ;=> "Table Jr."
;; equivalent expression:
(dot tab1 child name)
#+END_SRC

Since tables are mutable, the main way to populate them is to use the ~set!~
operator (the same one as for local variables). In this case, the first argument
may be any legal ~get~ or ~dot~ expression on a table.

# TODO: write code examples here
#+BEGIN_SRC fn
#+END_SRC

Lastly, tables size can be checked with ~length~, a list of keys can be retrieved
with ~table-keys~, and two or more tables can be combined with ~concat~ (if any of
the tables have keys in common, the last table in the argument list takes
priority).

[fn:key-equality] Two keys are equal if ~(= k1 k2)~ is true (using the builtin
equality function). For simple data types the meaning of equality is obvious.
Lists and tables are compared componentwise. That is, two lists are equal if and
only if all their respective entries are equal. Two tables are equal if their
key sets are equal (disregarding order), and for each key the corresponding
values in each table are equal.


*** Quoting

"Quoting" refers to the process of converting Fn source code into native Fn
data. This allows us to easily process and manipulate Fn source code using the
same facilities as for normal data.

Quoting is the secret sauce that makes Fn's macro system work. It's the main
reason why Fn has the syntax it has.

The ~quote~ special operator has syntax:
#+BEGIN_SRC fn
(quote <expr>) ;; or, equivalently
'<expr>
#+END_SRC
where ~<expr>~ can be any expression (in fact, it need not be a legal expression
by itself). These two notations are exactly the same. The interpreter expands
the second into the first before evaluation.

The value returned by quote is guaranteed to only consist of lists, symbols,
numbers, and strings. We refer to the latter three as *atoms*. Here are some
examples:
#+BEGIN_SRC fn
'(a b c) ;; returns ['a 'b 'c]
'"string" ;; returns "string"
'(+ a (/ x 2)) ;; returns ['+ 'a ['/ 'x 2]]

''quot ;; is equivalent to
(quote (quote quot)) ;; which returns ['quote 'quot]
#+END_SRC

Note that ~<expr>~ only needs to be syntactically valid (i.e. not freak out the
parser). Illegal expressions can be quoted just fine:
#+BEGIN_SRC fn
'() ;; returns [] (the empty list)
'(2 (3 4)) ;; returns [2 [3 4]]
'(quote) ;; returns ['quote]
#+END_SRC

This makes ~quote~ very handy for creating nested lists of atoms. (~quote~ also has
a big sister named ~quasiquote~, which is covered in the section on macros, and
allows for much more flexibility).

~quote~ is also the primary way to create symbols. As noted in subsection [[Simple
Data Types]], this can lead to problems when we want a symbol whose name is a
syntactically valid number. Adding an escape character to the symbol name
designates to the parser that the token should be read as a symbol rather than a
number. In fact, we can even use this trick to give variables numbers for names:
#+BEGIN_SRC fn
;; probably don't do this
(def \2 3)
2  ;; returns 2
\2 ;; returns 3
#+END_SRC

My recommendation: just don't use symbol names that are syntactically legal
numbers.


** TODO Control Flow and Functions

*** Conditional Execution

The conditional control flow primitives are ~if~ and ~cond~.


*** Creating Functions

Functions are created using ~fn~.

A short syntax is also provided for creating functions via the dollar sign,
which expands into a ~dollar-fn~ special form.


*** Variable Capture


** TODO Namespaces and Import

*** Namespaces and Packages

A namespace is a collection of global variables and macros. They are identified
by a name which is required to be globally unique. All Fn code lives inside of
some namespace.

Some examples of namespace names are:
#+BEGIN_SRC
fn/builtin
fn/repl
project/main
project/subsystem/parser
#+END_SRC

The slashes above are delimiters. In particular, everything to the left of the
last slash is called the *package name*, and the part to the right is called the
*short name*. For instance the namespace ~project/subsystem/parser~ has package
~project/subsystem~ and short name ~parser~.

We also have the concept of a *subpackage*. In the above examples,
~project/subsystem~ is a subpackage of ~project~. That is, the subpackages of a
~<pkg>~ are all packages with names of the form ~<pkg>/...~.


*** Namespace Determination

When a file is interpreted, the short name of the namespace is set to the stem
of the filename. There is no way to change this. The package, however, may be
anything at all, and is specified by putting a ~package~ declaration at the top of
the file:

#+BEGIN_SRC fn
(package myproject/util)
#+END_SRC

If no package declaration is present, the package ~fn/user~ is used by default.

Unlike other special forms in Fn, there can only be one package declaration per
file, and it must come at the beginning of the file, although it can be
preceeded by comments and whitespace.

The REPL allows the current namespace to be changed interactively. By default it
uses the namespace ~fn/repl~.


*** Importing Namespaces

Importing a namespace means taking its bindings into the current namespace.


*** Builtin Namespace

When a new namespace is created, an unqualified import of ~fn/builtin~ is
automatically performed.


*** Global Names

After a namespace has been imported once, its bindings can be referenced even
without importing it explicitly. This is done by using symbols whose names are
structured like with ~#:<namespace>:<symbol>~. For example, ~#:fn/builtin:map~
refers to the function ~map~ in the ~fn/builtin~ namespace.


** TODO Macros

*** Macro Basics

*** Quasiquotation

*** Variable Capture and ~gensym~


* Formal Semantics

This section is a formal description of every type of expression in Fn. It is
currently incomplete and inaccurate. I don't know why you'd want to look at it.

#+begin_src
program ::= expr* expr ::= immediate
        | variable
        | special-form
        | function-call
        | macro-call
#+end_src

** Immediate Expressions and Variables

Syntax:
#+begin_src
immediate ::= boolean 
          | null
          | number
          | string
variable ::= non-special-symbol
#+end_src

An immediate expression is a literal representing a constant value. On
evaluation, immediate expressions immediately return the value they represent.

Variables are represented by non-special symbols, (where special symbols are
those naming special forms, boolean values, or null). If there exists a binding
in the current environment for the provided symbol, then its value is returned.
Otherwise an exception is raised.


** Special forms

Special forms are so called because they have different semantics than function
or macro calls.

*** and
Syntax:
#+begin_src
and-expr ::= "(" "and" expr* ")"
#+end_src

Expressions are evaluated one at a time until a logically false value is
encountered, then returns ~false~. If the end of the list is reached, returns
~true~.

*** cond
Syntax:
#+begin_src
cond-expr ::= "(" "cond" cond-case+ ")"
cond-case ::= expr expr
#+end_src

For each cond-case, the following is done:
- evaluate the first expression
- if the first expression is logically true, return the value of the second
  expression
- otherwise, proceed to the next cond-case.

If the end of the list is reached, returns ~null~.
*** def
Syntax:
#+begin_src
def-expr ::= "(" "def" identifier expr ")"
         | "(" "def" func-proto expr+")"
func-proto ::= "(" identifier param-list ")"
#+end_src

Create a (global) binding in the current namespace. The first syntax binds the
identifier to the value of the expression. The second syntax creates a function
with the specified name and parameter list and the expressions as its body. In
either case, if the identifier is already bound, an exception is raised.

Returns ~null~.

*** TODO defmacro
Syntax:
#+begin_src
defmacro-expr ::= "(" "defmacro" identifier param-list expr+ ")"
#+end_src

*** defn
*** do
Syntax:
#+begin_src
do-expr ::= "(" "do" expr* ")"
#+end_src

Evaluates provided expressions one at a time, returning the value of the last
one, or ~null~ if no expressions are given.

*** do-inline
*** TODO dot
Syntax:
#+begin_src
dot-expr ::= dotted-symbol
           | "(" "dot" symbol+ ")"
#+end_src

This operator is usually used with the dotted-symbol syntax, e.g. ~table.key~.

The first symbol (leftmost in the inline notation) must name a variable bound to
a table. The next symbol is used as a key to access an element of the table. If
additional symbols are provided, then they are used as keys to recursively
descend into a tree of tables. An exception is raised if one of the keys is
invalid or if an attempt is made to access an object which is not a table.

*** dollar-fn
Syntax:
#+begin_src
dollar-fn-expr ::= "(" "dollar-fn" expr ")"
               | "$(" expr+ ")"
               | "$[" expr+ "]"
               | "${" expr+ "}"
               | "$`" form
#+end_src

Creates an anonymous function which evaluates the provided expression. With the
"$" syntax, this is the expression after the dollar sign. (The only expressions
which may follow are parenthesized forms, quasiquote forms, or list/table
expressions).

Within the provided expression, variables named ~$N~ where N is a nonnegative
integer, are bound to the corresponding positional parameters starting from 0.
In addition, ~$~ is bound to the first parameter ~$0~ and ~$&~ is used for a
variadic parameter.

The parameter list for the created function accepts as many positional
parameters as the highest value of N and a variadic parameter only if ~$&~
appears in the expression. (This is accomplished by performing code-walking,
including macroexpansion, before compiling the ~dollar-fn~).

*** if
Syntax:
#+begin_src
if-expr ::= "(" "if" test-expr expr expr ")"
test-expr ::= expr
#+end_src

Evaluates test-expr. If the result is logically true, evaluates the second
argument, otherwise evaluates final argument, returning the result.

*** TODO import
Syntax:
#+begin_src
import-expr ::= "(" "import" import-designator
                             [:as identifier] ")"
import-designator ::= string | symbol
#+end_src

Import bindings from another namespace. Every variable and macro definition from
the target namespace is copied into the current namespace. The newly created
bindings have names of the form ~namespace-name:variable-name~. Since it is
illegal to create variables whose names contain the colon character, this
ensures that no name collisions can occur, provided there is not already a
namespace imported with this name.

If an identifier is provided via the ~:as~ argument, then that is used instead of
the namespace name.

When ~import~ is used on a namespace that is not already loaded, the interpreter
checks for appropriate files in the search path, then compiles and loads them as
necessary.

**** Future changes

- Support for unqualified imports will be added (i.e. imports without the ~namespace~name:~
  prefix).
- Import may be changed so as to not recursively import imports from the package
  named. With current behavior, we could get names like ~ns1:ns2:function~ when
  ~ns1~ imports ~ns2~. This is mostly harmless, but we'd rather not overclutter
  namespaces if only for memory concerns. Also, it could definitely cause
  trouble if used with unqualified imports.
- Along with unqualified imports, we may add the notion of exports to
  namespaces, so that only certain bindings in a namespace are even made
  available to external namespaces. This is probably good for convenience for
  users of a library, but it also can give implementors some peace of mind
  knowing that their internal functions won't be called directly by user code.

*** fn
Syntax:
#+begin_src
fn-expr ::= "(" "fn" "(" param-list ")" expr+ ")"
#+end_src

Creates a function object using the provided parameter list and function body.

Functions have full variable capture semantics. Among other things, this means
that captured variables are shared among functions, so that if one function
mutates the variable, this change is reflected in the other functions accessing
the variable.

*** let
Syntax:
#+begin_src
let-expr ::= "(" "let" let-pair+ ")"
let-pair ::= identifier expr
#+end_src

Extends the current local environment. For each let-pair initially binds the
provided identifier to null. Then, in the order provided, each expression is
evaluated and the binding is updated to the resultant value.

The initial null-binding allows definition of recursive and even mutually
recursive functions. Care must be taken because this null binding will shadow
existing variables with the same name.

Returns null.

*** TODO letfn
*** TODO namespace
*** or
Syntax:
#+begin_src
or-expr ::= "(" "or" expr* ")"
#+end_src

Evaluates provided expressions one at a time until a logically true value is
obtained. Then returns ~true~. If the end of the list is reached, returns ~false~.

*** quasiquote
Syntax:
#+begin_src
quasiquote-expr ::= "`" form
                | "(" "quasiquote" form ")"
#+end_src

First, creates a fn object corresponding to form just like quote. Before
returning the form, the following transformation is done:
- The form is walked like a tree.
- When an unquote-expr is encountered, instead of descending into it, evaluate
  its argument and insert the result into the tree at that point.
- When an unquote-splicing form is encountered, instead of descending into it,
  evaluate its argument. If the result is not a list or if this is root of the
  tree, raise an error. Otherwise, splice the elements of the list inline into
  the tree at this point.
- Along the way, we keep track of all symbols whose names begin with a hash
  character "#". For each unique hash symbol, a single gensym is created, and
  the hash symbols are replaced by the gensyms in the final expansion. For
  example, see the following code snippet:
#+begin_src
`(#sym1 #sym2 #sym2) ; is the same as
(with (sym1 (gensym)
       sym2 (gensym))
 [sym1 sym2 sym2])
#+end_src
Note that #-symbols have lexical scope, i.e. they are shared by quasiquote forms
occurring within the outer form.

IMPLNOTE: the semantics of #-symbols may be too complicated for what they get
us. Might be better to just make the developer deal with ~gensym~ directly, or to
make #-symbols a feature of defmacro.

*** quote
Syntax:
#+begin_src
quote-expr ::= "'" form
           | "(" "quote" form ")"
#+end_src

Returns the syntactic form as an fn object (a tree of atoms and lists).

*** unquote
Syntax:
#+begin_src
unquote-expr ::= "," expr
             | "(" "unquote" expr ")"
#+end_src
Emits an error unless encountered within a quasiquote form.

*** unquote-splicing
Syntax:
#+begin_src
unquote-splicing-expr ::= ",@" expr | "(" "unquote-splicing" expr ")"
#+end_src
Emits an error unless encountered within a quasiquote form.

*** TODO set!
Syntax:
#+begin_src
set!-form ::= "(" "set!" place expr ")"
place ::= identifier 
      | dot-expr
      | get-form
get-form ::= "(" "get" expr+ ")"
#+end_src

*** with
Syntax:
#+begin_src
with-expr ::= "(" with-bindings expr+ ")"
with-bindings ::= "(" (id expr)* ")"
#+end_src

Behaves like ~let~, but rather than operating on the enclosing lexical
environment, instead creates a new child environment and adds bindings to that,
then evaluates the provided expressions in the newly created environment.

Note that this is how ~let~ works in most LISP-like languages.


** Function Calls

Syntax:
#+begin_src
function-call ::= "(" func argument-list ")"
#+end_src
where ~func~ may be any expression other than a reserved symbol.

First, the function and then all the arguments are evaluated from left to right.

Arguments are bound to parameters as follows:

Positional arguments are bound to the function's parameters in the order
provided. If there are more positional arguments than parameters, a list of the
extras are bound to the variadic list parameter if one exists. If not, an error
is generated.

After this, keyword arguments are bound to parameters by name. If two keyword
arguments have the same name, an error is raised. If the name isn't one of the
function's parameters, or if it names a parameter already provided by a
positional argument, it is added to the variadic table parameter if one exists.
If not, an error is raised.

If any parameters without default values remain unbound, an error is raised.

Then, the function is called. Foreign functions have behavior determined by the
external code they call. Ordinary functions work by switching back to the
lexical environment in which they were created, binding parameters as local
variables, and executing the function body.


** Macro Calls

Syntax:
#+begin_src
macro-call ::= "(" macro-name form* ")"
macro-name ::= identifier | dot-expr
#+end_src

The expressions for macro arguments aren't evaluated, but are converted to data
and passed to the macro function as arguments. The resultant value is treated as
code and evaluated.

In order to prevent ambiguity, macros do not recognize keyword arguments. A
keyword will be passed to the macro as a positional argument containing the
keyword symbol.


* Lexical Analysis

The component which processes Fn source into lexical tokens is called the
*scanner*. Conceptually, we put in a sequence of bytes and get back a sequence
of tokens.

Tokens are dividide into two groups: fixed width and variable width. The fixed
width tokens are:
- '(' :: left paren
- ')' :: right paren
- '[' :: left bracket
- ']' :: right bracket
- '{' :: left brace
- '}' :: right brace
- '\'' :: quote
- '`' :: backtick
- ',@' :: comma at
- ',' :: comma
- '$`' :: dollar backtick
- '$(' :: dollar paren
- '$[' :: dollar bracket
- '${' :: dollar brace

Fixed width tokens are generated when the scanner encounters one of the
corresponding quoted strings above.

Variable width tokens are:
- <number> :: numeric literal
- <string> :: string literal
- <symbol> :: symbol
- <dot> :: dot expression (2 or more symbols separated by '.')

** Comments

A comments begins with the unescaped character ~';'~ and end at the end of the
line.

Comments are skipped over without generating a token.

** Numbers, Symbols, and Dots

Numbers are defined according to regular expressions as in the following
pseudo-BNF grammar:

#+begin_src
<number> ::= "[+-]?(<dec>|<hex>)"
<dec>    ::= "[0-9]+\.?<exp>?"
           | "[0-9]*\.[0-9]+<exp>?"

A symbol is defined to be a sequence of symbol characters and escaped characters
which is not a number. Symbol characters are all printable ASCII characters
other than whitespace or those contained in the string ~";(){}[]\"\\'`,."~. An
escaped character is a sequence of two characters, the escape ~'\\'~ followed by
an arbitrary character. When the symbol is internalized, the escape character is
ignored, so its name will contain only the second character of the escape
sequence.

If an escape character is followed by EOF, a scanning error is raised.

Note that by injecting an escape character, one may cause numbers to be treated
as symbols. Adding an escape in front of any normal character normally no
effect, but in this case, it causes the number reader to fail, so the number's
characters will read as a symbol.

Finally, a dot token is a symbol token which contains the dot character ~'.'~,
subject to some additional restrictions. Dots can not occur in the first or last
position of the string, and it can not contain successive dots. In addition, the
substring before the first dot may not be a syntactically valid number. If any
of these conditions is violated, a scanning error is raised.

** TODO String Literals

String scanning starts when the scanner encounters the (unescaped) character
~'"'~ and ends when it encounters an unescaped ~'"'~. Along the way, all bytes
encountered are read verbatim, except for the escape character '\\', which is
followed by an escape sequence. The entire escape sequence is read into the
string according to the following table [fn:c-string-escapes]:
- '\'' :: single quote
- '\"' :: double quote
- '\?' :: question mark
- '\a' :: ASCII bell
- '\b' :: backspace
- '\f' :: form feed
- '\n' :: newline
- '\r' :: ASCII carriage return
- '\t' :: tab
- '\v' :: vertical tab
- '\NNN' (NNN is a 1- to 3- digit octal number) :: byte NNN (octal)
- '\xNN' (NN any two-digit hex number) :: the byte NN (hexadecimal)
- '\uC' (C any 4-digit hex unicode code point) :: unicode code point (2 bytes)
- '\UC' (C any 8-digit hex unicode code point) :: unicode code point (4 bytes)

[fn:c-string-escapes] These string escapes are mainly the same as the ones in C.

** Source Encoding

Currently, Fn only supports ASCII encoded text files. Behavior on other/extended
encodings is undefined. In the future, Fn will be extended so that UTF-8
characters can appear in strings and symbols.


* TODO Built-in Functions

Fn provides a number of built-in functions in the namespace ~fn.builtin~.
Whenever a new namespace is created, it automatically inherits all the bindings
from ~fn.builtin~, so these bindings are always available as global variables.

Builtin functions are split into primitive and nonprimitive functions. This
classification is not overly rigorous, but the rule is that primitive functions
expose core language functionality which cannot be used any other way. On the
other hand, all nonprimitive functions could theoretically be implemented in Fn
source code by using the primitives.

** Primitive Functions

- apply (obj arg0 arg1 & args) :: Call obj as a function. Positional arguments
  for the call are generated by taking a list of all but the last two arguments
  (to apply), and concatenating that with the second-to-last argument, which
  must be a list. The last argument (to apply) is a table of keyword arguments.

- gensym () :: Generate a symbol with a guaranteed unique id. This is used for
  macro writing.
- symbol-name (x) :: get the name of a symbol as a string

- length (obj) :: Depending on the type of obj, returns
  - the length of a string in bytes,
  - the number of elements in a list, or
  - the number of keys in a table or namespace.
- concat (seq0 & seqs) :: Concatenate strings or lists. All the arguments must
  be of the same type.
- nth (n seq) :: Get the nth element of a list or string. If seq is a string the
  result will be a string of length 1 containing the (n-1)th byte of the string.

- = :: check for equality
- same? :: check for equality
- not :: logical not

- bool? ::
- function? ::
- int? ::
- list? ::
- namespace? ::

- empty? (obj) :: Equivalent to ~(= obj [])~.
- cons (hd tl) :: Create a new list by prepending hd to tl.
- head (list) :: get the first element of a list. Error on empty.
- tail (list) :: drop the first element of a list. Returns empty on empty.

Tables and Namespaces:
- Table (& kv-pairs) :: Create a table. The argument list is a sequence
  of pairs consisting of keys followed by values.
- get (key obj) :: access a field from a table or namespace
- get-keys (obj) :: get a list of keys from a table or namespace
- has-key? (obj key) :: get a list of keys from a table or namespace
