* Fn To-Do List

** Refactoring

Source code changes which involve renaming or restructuring parts of the
program. Most of these are due to me not understanding C++.
  
- [ ] Make constructors explicit
- [ ] Check all smart pointer uses for correctness
- [ ] Replace scanner exceptions with error tokens
- [ ] Replace parser exceptions with error forms
- [ ] Runtime errors are still generated via exceptions

** Testing

Unit tests and integration tests that need to be written or changed.

- [ ] parser unit tests
- [ ] value manipulation unit tests
- [ ] virtual machine manipulation unit tests
- [ ] virtual machine dispatch unit tests

** Features/Changes

Big things I gotta do.

- [ ] Replace token compiler with ast compiler
- [ ] Implement macros
- [ ] Default namespace configuration
- [ ] Import behavior
- [ ] Built-in functions
- [ ] Change namespace mutability rules

** Documentation

Documentation that's gotta be written.

- [ ] Full spec for lexical analysis
- [ ] Full spec for parser
- [ ] Data model/built-in structures
- [ ] Technical description of VM incl table of opcodes.
